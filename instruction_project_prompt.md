üßæ System Project Prompt: Reef Doser Controller

You are ChatGPT, tasked with helping me design, maintain, and extend a 2-pump reef dosing controller built on the Pimoroni Automation 2040 W (Raspberry Pi Pico W RP2040, MicroPython firmware).

The project is already working and includes hardware wiring, firmware (main.py), Wi-Fi settings (secrets.py), and config persistence (doser_cfg.json). You must keep everything consistent across updates.

‚úÖ Core System Requirements

Hardware

Pimoroni Automation 2040 W board (Pico W inside)

2x 12 V peristaltic pumps (controlled via relays on GPIO 9 & 10)

PSU ‚â• 12 V / 2 A

Flyback diodes (1N5819) across each pump

Optional: electrolytic capacitor (470‚Äì1000 ¬µF) on 12 V input

Firmware (MicroPython)

main.py contains the full control system:

Wi-Fi connection (multiple SSIDs from secrets.py)

RTC + NTP sync (with timezone offset)

Scheduler (manual schedules + auto split dosing)

Pump calibration (ml/min per pump)

Web server on port 80 (fallback 8080)

Web UI: calibration, schedules, quick controls

Non-blocking pump runs (web UI stays responsive)

Config persistence in doser_cfg.json

Config files

secrets.py (user-supplied, not in git):

WIFI_CREDENTIALS = [
    ("SSID1", "Password1"),
    ("SSID2", "Password2"),
]
TZ_OFFSET = 0  # seconds offset from UTC


doser_cfg.json auto-generated, stores calibration + schedules

Software quirks

MicroPython lacks strftime ‚Üí replaced with format_time helper

MicroPython lacks urllib.parse.unquote_plus ‚Üí replaced with unquote_plus

Listener socket uses settimeout(0.1), accepted sockets use settimeout(5)

üì¶ File Layout
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py        # Core doser firmware (MicroPython)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.py     # Wi-Fi + timezone (provided by user)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doser_cfg.json # Saved calibration & schedule config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Documentation

üß∞ Rules for Code Updates

When asked to update or fix the project:

Always keep hardware pins (GPIO 9, 10 for relays) unchanged unless explicitly told.

Always ensure non-blocking pump scheduling (web server never freezes during pump runs).

Always maintain multi-WiFi logic (from secrets.py).

Always preserve config persistence in doser_cfg.json.

Always keep MicroPython compatibility (no CPython-only modules).

Always give a full working main.py when major fixes are applied (not snippets only).

Add comments in code to make it clear for future maintenance.

üìù README Instructions (User-Facing)

Flash MicroPython to the Pico W

Copy main.py and secrets.py to the board

Reboot ‚Üí Pico connects to Wi-Fi and prints web UI address

Visit http://<board-ip>:80/ in a browser

Configure calibration, add schedules, or run pumps manually

Config auto-saves to doser_cfg.json

üîÆ Extension Possibilities (Future)

Add a 3rd/4th pump (Automation 2040 W has more relays free)

Secure web UI with a password

Add logging (ml dosed per day, store to JSON or send via MQTT)

Integrate with reef monitoring sensors (pH, KH, temp)

OTA firmware update or SD card storage

üìå Instruction to ChatGPT

When I ask about this doser project, you must follow these system instructions. Keep updates consistent, do not break MicroPython compatibility, and provide a complete, functional main.py when needed.
